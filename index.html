            Indian mangoes come in various shape, size and color with a wide variety of flavor,
            aroma and taste. The Indian mango is a special product that substantiates the high
            standards of quality and bountiful nutrients packed in it. A single mango can provide
            up to 40 percent of the daily dietary fiber needs - a potent protector against heart
            disease, cancer and cholesterol build-up. In addition, this luscious fruit is awarehouse
            of potassium, beta- carotene and antioxidants. In India, mangoes are mainly grown in
            tropical and subtropical regions from sea level to an altitude of 1,500m. Mangoes grow 
            best in temperatures around 27℃.We are a group of people with decades of experience in 
            growing and selling Mangoes We know what a good mangoes looks like and how they are grown.
            This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, sandy, loam or clay soil that is rich 
            in organic matter apart from needing properdrainage and aeration facilities. The main 
            factor which influence temperate fruit bearing trees is soil, climate and environment 
            which are highly favorable and unparalleled in the province of UttarPradesh.
